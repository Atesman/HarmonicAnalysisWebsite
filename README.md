# Harmonic Analysis Tool

This is the source code for an online harmonic analysis tool, a dynamic website built with React for musicians, composers, and music enthusiasts. This tool allows users to perform a comprehensive harmonic analysis of any musical scale they input, providing a deep dive into the musical possibilities contained within.

## Features

- **Scale Input**: Users can input any musical scale to initiate the analysis.
- **Chord Calculation**: The tool calculates all possible chords that can be derived from the given scale.
- **Key Selection**: Users have the option to select a musical key to view the chords specific to that key.
- **Chord Representation**: Chords are displayed both in standard notation and in a Roman numeral system, accommodating different levels of musical theory knowledge.
- **Scale Degrees**: The tool displays the scale intervals, enhancing understanding of the scale's structure.
- **Scale Recognition**: The tool recognizes a large number of musical scales and provides detailed information on recognized scales, enhancing educational value.

## How It Works

1. **Enter a Scale**: Start by entering the notes of your scale.
2. **Select a Key** (optional): Choose a key to view the chords in that specific key.
3. **Explore Chords and Scale Degrees**: View the chords and their Roman numeral notation, along with the scale degrees.

## Technology Stack

- **React**: Utilizes React for efficient, interactive UI components.
- **Custom Harmonic Analysis Algorithm**: Analyzes scales client-side using custom algorithm
